## Strategy

## Scope

## Structure

## Skeleton

## Surface

Most of the website color is created using HEX.
The main color used is Khaki #C1A894 giving the whole background a warm color.Darker colors on the header and the footer for more earthy effect #8C6042 and #A37150. The purpose was to have a calmness feeling through the website which will help to reflect how it will actually be in the spa.I used "https://coolors.co/3a3a3a-8c6042-a37150-c1a894-a7bbec" to generate my color palette.
